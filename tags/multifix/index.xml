      <description>I acquired a Chinese knockoff of the Swiss Multifix (size A) quick change tool post from my good friend Emma, along with a couple of 16mm tool holders and a blank tool holder suitable for making custom tools with.
This QCTP is truly exceptional compared to the tiny Fortuna/Dickson style that I got shortly after the lathe and really was undersized. The Multifix A is perhaps the largest toolpost one can comfortably use with this machine, and while most of the toolholders are for 16mm (5/8 in) tools, the largest tools one can hold is 14mm (a bit over 1/2 in).</description>
