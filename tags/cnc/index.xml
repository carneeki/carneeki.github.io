      <description>Conversion of the RF30 to CNC was not an easy task for me. Originally, I wanted to make circuit boards without the use of chemicals. This is a process called &amp;ldquo;isolation routing&amp;rdquo; where a very small router bit cutter goes around the traces of the copper to isolate that trace. The board is then drilled and removed for soldering.
When I started this project in 2012, I received a lot of bad advice from a close family friend, a machinist of over 50 years, who I thought knew better.</description>
