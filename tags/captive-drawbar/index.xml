      <description>Introduction A drawbar is basically a really long screw or bolt which pulls a collet (or other tool) up into a taper. Sometimes the tool gets stuck in the taper, and so instead of the tool (&amp;ldquo;nut&amp;rdquo;) being pushed down, the drawbar (&amp;ldquo;screw&amp;rdquo;) is pushed up. A captive drawbar holds the drawbar down so it cannot be pushed up, this forces the tool out of the taper.
A captive drawbar is a neat addition to a vertical milling machine because it improves the usability of the machine in a subtle way.</description>
