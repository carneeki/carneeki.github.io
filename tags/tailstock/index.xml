      <description>Introduction - The problem so far The CQ6125 I received had very poor heat treatment on the screw to feed the quill forwards, and the thread has cracked several times near the tip reducing the travel by a few millimetres. When combined with MT3 tooling with a tang, a further 25mm is lost, reducing the total travel to about 35mm out of 65mm! I can get by with tangless tapers, but there has to be a better way.</description>
